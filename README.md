# Nessus-Vulnerability-Management
This repository documents my Nessus Vulnerability Management Portfolio Project, showcasing vulnerability management using Nessus. I conducted scans from a Kali Linux VM against both a Kali and a Windows 10 VM on Azure. The project highlights Nessusâ€™s effectiveness in identifying and remediating vulnerabilities across different operating systems.
