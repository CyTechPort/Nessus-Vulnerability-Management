# Nessus Vulnerability Management Portfolio Project

## Overview

This repository documents my portfolio project on vulnerability management using Nessus. I executed multiple vulnerability scans from a pre-existing Kali Linux VM against both a Kali VM and a Windows 10 VM hosted on Azure. The project illustrates the effectiveness of Nessus in identifying and remediating vulnerabilities across different operating systems.

## Features

- Conducted several vulnerability scans using Nessus:
  - Initial scan to assess baseline vulnerabilities.
  - Credentialed scan using an admin account on the Windows 10 VM.
  - Scan targeting a deprecated Firefox installation.
- Generated comprehensive reports on identified vulnerabilities.
- Demonstrated effective remediation practices.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, I ensured the following:

- **Azure Account**: An active Azure account to access pre-existing VMs.
- **Nessus**: A Nessus account to download and install the Nessus scanner. [Nessus Download](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus).
- **Network Configuration**: Both VMs were configured on the same virtual network in Azure to allow seamless communication.

## Installation

### 1. Set Up Kali Linux VM

1. I utilized an existing Kali Linux VM hosted on Azure.
2. Updated the Kali machine:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

### 2. Install Nessus on Kali

1. Downloaded the Nessus installation package for Debian from [Nessus Download](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus).
2. Installed Nessus:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i Nessus-*.*.deb
   ```

3. Started the Nessus service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
   ```

4. Accessed the Nessus web interface at `https://<Kali_VM_Public_IP>:8834/` to complete the setup.

### 3. Set Up Windows 10 VM

1. Used an existing Windows 10 VM on Azure, ensuring it was up-to-date.
2. Created an admin account on the Windows 10 VM for credentialed scanning.

2. **Create Multiple Scans**:
   - **Initial Scan**:
     - Clicked on "Scans" > "New Scan".
     - Selected the Basic Network Scan template.
     - Configured the scan settings, targeting both VMs.
     - Saved the configuration and launched the scan.

   - **Credentialed Scan**:
     - Created a new scan using the same template.
     - Under "Credentials," added the admin account details for the Windows VM.
     - Saved and launched the scan to assess vulnerabilities with elevated permissions.

   - **Scan for Deprecated Firefox Installation**:
     - Created another new scan targeting the Windows VM specifically for deprecated software.
     - Launched the scan to identify issues related to the outdated Firefox installation.

## Results Interpretation

- **Initial Scan Results**: Identified baseline vulnerabilities for both VMs, providing a comprehensive overview of security posture.
  
- **Credentialed Scan Results**: Revealed additional vulnerabilities not detected in the initial scan, highlighting the importance of using credentials for deeper insights.

- **Deprecated Firefox Scan**:
  - Identified the outdated Firefox installation as a vulnerability.
  - **Remediation**: Uninstalled Firefox to mitigate the associated risk:
    ```bash
    sudo apt remove firefox
    ```

- **Severity Levels**: Vulnerabilities were categorized by severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Info.
- **Reporting**: Exported scan results in PDF format for documentation and further analysis.

## Conclusion

This project effectively demonstrates the use of Nessus for vulnerability management in a cloud environment with pre-existing Kali Linux and Windows 10 VMs on Azure. It emphasizes the importance of conducting both initial and credentialed scans, as well as the need for timely remediation of identified vulnerabilities.
